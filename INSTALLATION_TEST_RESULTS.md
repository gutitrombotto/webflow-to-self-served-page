```json
{
  "name": "webflow-plugins",  // Changed from "Webflow to Self-Served Page"
  "description": "Official marketplace for Webflow conversion plugins",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Agustin Trombotto",
    "email": "agustin@filadd.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "webflow-to-self-served-page",
      "source": "./",
      "repository": "https://github.com/gutitrombotto/webflow-to-self-served-page",
      // Changed from object to string format
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Result After Fix
‚úÖ Schema validation passed
